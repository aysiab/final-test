# INFO 201 Final Project - Diversity in Comic Book Characters

We will be working with a dataset from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/comic-characters) that has information on comic book characters. The information includes a character’s physical attributes, the years they have appeared in a book, their gender, if they are considered a hero or villain, and more. The data comes from Marvel Wikia and DC Wikia and is accessed from FiveThirtyEight from GitHub.

We decided our target audience would mainly be comic book fans and those interested in diversity studies because our dataset is based on comic book characters and how each character is different in terms of appearance and intentions.

Specific questions we will focus on will include the relationships between two (or more) variables. For example, a specific characteristic frequency vs year to see if a certain physical attribute or color is more popular depending on time, one’s gender vs if they are on the good or bad side, year vs sexual minority representation, and if a color is associated with a hero or villain.
